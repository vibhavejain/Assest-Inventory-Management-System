  "product_overview": "This project focuses on comprehensive frontend automation testing for the Asset Inventory Management System (AIMS), a React and TypeScript based web app managing companies, users, assets, and audit logs. It ensures functionality, usability, and stability through unit, component, integration, E2E, visual regression, and accessibility testing.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Ensure UI components behave correctly under all states and interactions",
    "Validate API interaction and data flow between components and backend",
    "Verify critical user workflows perform end-to-end without errors",
    "Maintain high test coverage across unit, integration, and E2E levels",
    "Catch visual and accessibility regressions early in development",
    "Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines for continuous quality assurance"
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Comprehensive unit and component tests for all UI primitives (Button, Input, Select, Modal, Badge, etc.)",
    "Business component tests for complex components like AssetCard, UserCard, CompanyCard, AuditLogCard",
    "Page-level integration tests covering all main pages: Dashboard, Companies, Users, Assets, Audit Logs, Settings",
    "End-to-end test workflows simulating critical paths like company setup, asset assignment, audit trail verification, and data persistence",
    "Visual regression testing of key components and pages across device breakpoints",
    "Accessibility testing based on WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines using axe-core integration",
    "Test data management with fixtures, mocks, and seeding strategies",
    "CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on push/pull requests"
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User lands on Dashboard, views KPIs, and navigates via sidebar to other pages",
    "User lists and creates companies, with status filtering and pagination",
    "User views and edits company details, manages users and assets assigned to company",
    "User lists and creates users, filters by status and company, and deletes users",
    "User lists and manages assets with creation, filtering, assignment, and conditional deletion",
    "User views audit logs filtered by company, entity type, and action, with pagination and detailed views",
    "User toggles application theme and manages settings",
    "Modal forms open on user action for creating or editing entities, focusing input and trapping keyboard focus",
    "Interactive cards expand/collapse to show detailed info and support data updates via API calls"
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Unit tests cover all utility functions and UI primitives with at least 90% component coverage",
    "Component tests properly handle all visual states, user interactions, loading, and error scenarios",
    "Integration tests mock backend API calls and verify data flow and UI updates",
    "E2E tests cover critical paths with real data setup and persistence validation",
    "Visual regression tests detect UI changes across states and breakpoints",
    "Accessibility tests report zero critical violations according to axe-core",
    "All tests run successfully and reliably in CI/CD pipelines within defined time limits",
    "Audit logs correctly reflect all create/update/delete actions triggered by UI operations"
