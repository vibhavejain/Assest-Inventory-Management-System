#### Test TC013
- **Test Name:** TC013-Accessibility Validation Using axe-core
- **Test Code:** [TC013_Accessibility_Validation_Using_axe_core.py](./TC013_Accessibility_Validation_Using_axe_core.py)
- **Test Error:** The task goal was to run automated axe-core accessibility scans on major pages and UI components, ensuring there are zero critical violations per WCAG 2.1 AA. However, the last action of clicking the 'View details' button for the first company, Bootminds, did not succeed due to a timeout error. 

### Analysis:
1. **Task Goal**: Ensure accessibility scans with no critical violations.
2. **Last Action**: Attempted to click the 'View details' button.
3. **Error**: The click action timed out after 5000ms, indicating that the button was not interactable within the specified time frame.

### Explanation:
The error occurred because the locator for the button could not be found or was not ready for interaction within the allotted time. This could be due to several reasons:
- The button may not be visible or enabled at the time of the click attempt.
- There could be a delay in rendering the button on the page, possibly due to network latency or JavaScript execution.
- The XPath used to locate the button might be incorrect or too specific, leading to it not being found.

To resolve this issue, consider the following steps:
- Verify the XPath to ensure it correctly points to the button.
- Increase the timeout duration to allow more time for the button to become interactable.
- Implement a wait condition to check for the button's visibility or enabled state before attempting to click it.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d1a91100-c306-4e7b-8a83-e0bfc8f1f551/e94eaa6d-25e5-43fb-a6f7-66b03dc2db66

#### Test TC014
- **Test Name:** TC014-API Failure Handling During Data Fetch
- **Test Code:** [TC014_API_Failure_Handling_During_Data_Fetch.py](./TC014_API_Failure_Handling_During_Data_Fetch.py)
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d1a91100-c306-4e7b-8a83-e0bfc8f1f551/520f16f4-3e52-4afd-9f87-8021999fce01

#### Test TC015
- **Test Name:** TC015-Audit Log Reflects UI Triggered Create/Update/Delete Actions
- **Test Code:** [TC015_Audit_Log_Reflects_UI_Triggered_CreateUpdateDelete_Actions.py](./TC015_Audit_Log_Reflects_UI_Triggered_CreateUpdateDelete_Actions.py)
- **Test Error:** The audit log verification task could not be completed because the main page of the application is completely empty with no interactive elements to perform create, update, or delete actions or to access audit logs. The issue has been reported for resolution. Please fix the UI issue and retry the task.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d1a91100-c306-4e7b-8a83-e0bfc8f1f551/dc91d634-fd30-4e4f-8019-ee2201a765c9

#### Test TC016
- **Test Name:** TC016-Loading and Empty State Visuals for UI Components
- **Test Code:** [TC016_Loading_and_Empty_State_Visuals_for_UI_Components.py](./TC016_Loading_and_Empty_State_Visuals_for_UI_Components.py)
- **Test Error:** The test failed because the click action on the 'Add Company' button timed out after 5000 milliseconds. The error log indicates that the button was visible and enabled, but a backdrop overlay (a div with class 'absolute inset-0 bg-black/50 backdrop-blur-sm') was intercepting pointer events, preventing the click from being registered. This suggests that a modal or loading spinner was likely displayed on the screen, blocking interaction with the button. To resolve this issue, ensure that any overlays or modals are properly dismissed or hidden before attempting to click the button again.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d1a91100-c306-4e7b-8a83-e0bfc8f1f551/d594bdfa-55d6-447b-8ae6-09cce35e5512

#### Test TC017
- **Test Name:** TC017-Expandable Cards Interaction and Data Update
- **Test Code:** [TC017_Expandable_Cards_Interaction_and_Data_Update.py](./TC017_Expandable_Cards_Interaction_and_Data_Update.py)
- **Test Error:** The task goal was to verify that interactive cards, such as the 'Bootminds' company card, can expand to reveal more details and support data updates through API calls. However, the last action of clicking on the card failed due to a timeout error. Specifically, the locator for the card was not found within the specified timeout of 5000 milliseconds, which indicates that the element may not have been present in the DOM at the time of the click attempt. This could be due to several reasons: the card may not have loaded yet, the XPath used to locate the card may be incorrect, or there may be a delay in rendering the UI after the previous action. To resolve this, ensure that the card is fully loaded and visible before attempting to click, and verify the XPath for accuracy.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d1a91100-c306-4e7b-8a83-e0bfc8f1f551/45a33f82-442c-448b-a459-c47d9a344af6

#### Test TC018
- **Test Name:** TC018-CI/CD Pipeline Test Execution and Stability
- **Test Code:** [TC018_CICD_Pipeline_Test_Execution_and_Stability.py](./TC018_CICD_Pipeline_Test_Execution_and_Stability.py)
- **Test Error:** The GitHub Actions tab does not show recent workflow runs or test results, so automated test validation in the CI/CD pipeline cannot be completed. Please ensure the CI/CD workflows are properly configured and recent runs are visible.
